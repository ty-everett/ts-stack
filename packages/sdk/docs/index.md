# BSV TypeScript SDK Documentation

## SDK Overview

The BSV TypeScript SDK is designed to provide an updated and unified layer for developing scalable applications on the BSV Blockchain. It addresses the limitations of previous tools by offering a Direct Instant Payments (DIP) approach, ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Installation

To install the SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @bsv/sdk
```

You can then import modules from the SDK as follows:

```ts
import { WalletClient, PrivateKey, Transaction } from "@bsv/sdk";
```

Or using require syntax:

```js
const { WalletClient, PrivateKey, Transaction } = require("@bsv/sdk");
```


## BRC-100 Application to Wallet Interface

This interface is what most application developers will use to interact with the BSV blockchain.

BSV Desktop and BSV Browser are the BSV Association reference implementations for BRC-100. Vendor distributions, including Babbage's Metanet Desktop / Metanet Explorer and Hudos Browser, can implement the same interface with their own branding and service defaults.
